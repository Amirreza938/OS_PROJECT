# OS_PROJECT
in this project we are developing a shop which is working based on multithreading.
in the first step, we commenced to load data set, cause of that I made the file data_load.c and read data from the path which my data_set is located. we consider three structures named product,store and category.
these structures are used to have all data_set level by level, for instance in output we will see first the name of store, then all categories in it and at last all products of each category.
